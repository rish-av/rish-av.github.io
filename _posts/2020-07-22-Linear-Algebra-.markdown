In this post I will mainly discuss about the following important linear algebra concept which are quintessential for Machine Learning. There are several blogs available related to various topic but I haven't seen a post where things have been consolidated and the real life application of that concept has been explained. This post covers the following:

- Various types of Products in Linear Algebra
- Norms
- Linear Independence & Rank
- Range & Null Space
- Determinants
- Quadratic Form & Positive Semidefinite Matrices
- Eigen Values & Eigen Vectors
- Matrix Calculus (Hessian, Gradients etc.)

This is going to be a long one (not very long though :-P ), so let's go!!
