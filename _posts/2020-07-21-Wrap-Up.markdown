I came to Pilani in the summers of 2016 (July to be precise). I was excited as well as dejected. I was excited because I was about to start my new journey away from the comforts of my home at one of India's prime institutions. I was dejected because I failed miserably in the joint entrance examination, for which I slogged for two consecutive years. But whatever, this was a monumental change in my life & lifestyle. I still remember holding my tears while my parents were bidding me the final goodbye. 

'Life' started very soon in Pilani. It was confusing to me, right from the online time table system to picking courses. I  thank my 1st room-mate for guiding me through the process, and I was finally able to crack the methodology of doing such stuff. Time Table & registration was never a problem since then.

1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year, and finally, the 4th one went by without me noticing. But these years gave me so many beautiful memories, great friends, and a special 'friend' whom I, unfortunately, lost due to my actions. Even a book of 1000 pages would not be enough to describe my journey completely, and a book of infinite pages won't be enough to describe the contributions that many great people had in my life. Hence, I would keep it short and mention just the critical outcomes.

From my first year itself, what I was not afraid of was trying things out. I tried almost everything, from graphic designing to frontend development to android programming to what not. I did lose grades in the process, but do I have any regrets? No. But what I was afraid of or cared about was the 'public opinion' about me. But with time and open *grilling* sessions by some caring friends, that vice was successfully eliminated. 

**I will complete this soon :) **
