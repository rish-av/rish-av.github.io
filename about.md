Hi There!

### Research Interests

My name is Rishav (yeah, no surname :-P). I am a final year undergraduate student at BITS Pilani. I am passionate about research in Artificial Intelligence, specifically Computer Vision. I like to code in python. I completed my bachelor thesis at DFKI Kaiserslautern under Prof. Dr. Didier Stricker. I worked along side Rene Schuster, Ramy Battrawy and Oliver Wasenmueller. I worked on **Deep Learning for Scene Flow Estimation using monocular camera & sparse LiDAR**. The work has been published in the form of 2 papers at top conferences, they can be found in the publications page.

During my 4 years at BITS Pilani, I tried almost everything, from graphic designing to web developement to android programming but computer vision came out to be the one which really stuck with me. I did loose some grades meanwhile but I have no regrets since the experience of trying everything out and narrowing my interests definitely made my future path crystal clear for me. Apart from deep learning, I am also a fan of algorithmic programming and like to code as a brain train excercise.


### Other Interests

While I am not working, I would be reading about some historical events or playing flute or teaching kids. I am a huge admirer of ancient India. I consider learning a hobby. You can never stop to learn. Also, Yoga is life :), Following *shlokas* from *Maha Upanishads* have always inspired me:

```
1. ॐ सर्वेशां स्वस्तिर्भवतु ।
सर्वेशां शान्तिर्भवतु ।
सर्वेशां पुर्णंभवतु ।
सर्वेशां मङ्गलंभवतु ।
ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥

2. वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम् |
```

Which means:

```
1. May there be Well-Being in All,
May there be Peace in All,
May there be Fulfilment in All,
May there be Auspiciousness in All,
Om Peace, Peace, Peace.

2. The whole world is one family.
```

I also love rock music from the 80s and 90s, *Scorpions, Queen* have a special place in my heart.

### Long Term Interests

Eventhough I hate making long term plans, my goal is to use AI for problems that matter and not just the problems for which we have dataset available. India is a representative of the problems faced by the developing world and a lot of them can be solved with use of smart tech and AI. AI has the solutions to long term problems like climate change. Overall, AI if used ethically has a solution for a sustainable world.


Would you like to talk more? let`s meet for a cup of coffee (or a can of Redbull :-P), drop me an email, more often than not, I will reply quickly.
