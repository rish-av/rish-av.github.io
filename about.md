Thanks for visiting my website! 

My name is Rishav (yeah, no surname :-P). I am a final year undergraduate student at BITS Pilani. I am passionate about research in Artificial Intelligence, specifically computer vision. I like to code in python. Overall, I am just another human being interested in imparting knowledge to artificial agents.

I am also a fan of algorithmic programming and like to code as a brain train excercise.

While I am not working, I would be reading about some historical events or learning flute. I love to travel.
I am an Indian at heart. I love the colors, chaos, food and wonders of India. I am specially a big admirer of ancient India.

Would you like to talk more? let`s meet for a cup of coffee (or a can of Redbull :-P), drop me an email, more often than not, I will reply instantly.
