Hi There!

My name is Rishav (yeah, no surname :-P). I am a final year undergraduate student at BITS Pilani. I am passionate about research in Artificial Intelligence, specifically computer vision. I believe AI has the solution to several problems that matter for the overall good of everyone. I like to code in python. 

I am also a fan of algorithmic programming and like to code as a brain train excercise.

While I am not working, I would be reading about some historical events or playing flute or teaching kids. I am a huge admirer of ancient India. I consider learning a hobby. You can never stop to learn. Also, Yoga is life :), Following *shloks* from the *Maha Upanishads* have always inspired me:

```
1. ॐ सर्वेशां स्वस्तिर्भवतु ।
सर्वेशां शान्तिर्भवतु ।
सर्वेशां पुर्णंभवतु ।
सर्वेशां मङ्गलंभवतु ।
ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥

2. वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम् |
```

Which means:

```
1. May there be Well-Being in All,
May there be Peace in All,
May there be Fulfilment in All,
May there be Auspiciousness in All,
Om Peace, Peace, Peace.

2. The whole world is one family.
```


Would you like to talk more? let`s meet for a cup of coffee (or a can of Redbull :-P), drop me an email, more often than not, I will reply quickly.
