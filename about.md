Thanks for visiting my website! 

My name is Rishav (yeah, no surname :-P). I am a final year undergraduate student at BITS Pilani. I am passionate about research in Artificial Intelligence, specifically computer vision. I like to code in python. Overall, I am just another human being interested in imparting knowledge to artificial agents.

I am also a fan of algorithmic programming and like to code as a brain train excercise.

I love to travel. I love history. I write [sometimes](https://rish-av.github.io).
I am an Indian at heart. I love the colors, chaos, food and wonders of India.

Would you like to talk more? let's meet for a cup of coffee (or a can of Redbull :-P), drop me an email, more often than not, I'll reply instantly.
