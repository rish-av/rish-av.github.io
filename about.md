Hi There!
My name is Rishav (yeah, no surname :-P). I am a final year undergraduate student at BITS Pilani (about to graduate).

***Research Interests***

During my undergrad years at BITS Pilani, I tried almost everything, from graphic designing to web developement to android programming to see what really *excites* me. Finally, artificial intelligence, more specifically computer vision was something that really stuck with me. I did loose some grades in the process but I have no regrets since I believe the experience of trying everything out was priceless and I anyways have never been good at writing exams ;). Apart from artificial intelligence, I am also a fan of algorithmic programming and like to code as a brain train excercise.

As stated earlier, my primary research interests lie in the field of computer vision (all sorts of problems). I recently completed my bachelor thesis at DFKI Kaiserslautern under [Prof. Dr. Didier Stricker](https://av.dfki.de/members/stricker/). I worked along side [René Schuster](https://av.dfki.de/members/schuster/), [Ramy Battrawy](https://av.dfki.de/members/battrawy/) and [Oliver Wasenm&uuml;ller](https://av.dfki.de/members/wasenmueller/). I worked on **Deep Learning for Scene Flow Estimation using monocular camera & sparse LiDAR**. Parts from the work have been published at top conferences, refer [here](https://rish-av.github.io/publications/).

***Other Interests***

While I am not working, I like to read about historical events or play flute or teach kids. I am a huge admirer of ancient India. I consider learning a hobby. One can never stop to learn. Also, Yoga is life :), Following *shlokas* from *Maha Upanishads* have always inspired me:

```
ॐ सर्वेशां स्वस्तिर्भवतु ।
सर्वेशां शान्तिर्भवतु ।
सर्वेशां पुर्णंभवतु ।
सर्वेशां मङ्गलंभवतु ।
ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥

-----

वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम् |
```

Which means:

```
May there be Well-Being in All,
May there be Peace in All,
May there be Fulfilment in All,
May there be Auspiciousness in All,
Om Peace, Peace, Peace.

The whole world is one family.
```

I also love rock music from the 80s and 90s, *Scorpions, Queen* have a special place in my heart. You can find me on [spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/31qhhbgjwrtuvru26fbwxvs5ohpq?si=wZ9dYuO9TfGS9Nzo1HuCdw).

***Long Term Vision***

Eventhough I hate making long term plans, my goal is to use AI for problems that matter and not just the problems for which we have datasets available. I strive to work for solutions that can have an impact at the lowest stratas of society. India is the representative of the problems faced by the developing world and a lot of them can be solved with use of smart tech and AI. I believe AI has potential solutions to problems like climate change, healthcare, safe driving etc. Overall, AI, if used ethically has a solution for a sustainable world.


Would you like to talk more? meet me for a cup of coffee (or a can of Redbull :-P), drop an email, more often than not, I will reply within 24 hours.
