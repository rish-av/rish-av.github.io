                <strong>Unsupervised Cross Spectral Stereo Matching </strong> PyTorch implmentation of the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01078"> [Unsupervised Cross-spectral Stereo Matching by Learning to Synthesize] </a> The method uses CycleGAN to learn translation from one spectrum to the other and then uses it to train a stereo matching network based on unsupervised loses. Currently working on integrating contrastive losses for robust image translation. <br>
