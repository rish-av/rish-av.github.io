I’m Rishav, an engineer at heart driven by the challenge of building machine learning systems that work reliably at scale.  I’m currently at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en), where my research focuses on **real-time and explainable reinforcement learning**. My long-term goal is to develop **trustworthy systems that can learn efficiently from feedback**, moving beyond today’s models that need millions of samples for even basic tasks.  

Before Mila, I co-founded [Offside](https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/539173-27), where I built and scaled the product to 100k users and raised $300k from top-tier VCs and angels. Earlier, I spent two enriching years at [DFKI](http://dfki.de) in Germany, developing real-time vision algorithms for precision farming—here’s a glimpse of that work: [Spot Spraying for Precision Agriculture](https://rish-av.github.io/blog/2024/spotspraying/). I graduated from [BITS Pilani](https://bits-pilani.ac.in/) in 2020 with a degree in Computer Science.  

## Research Interests

My current research focuses on Offline RL problems, particularly explainability and adaptive regularization. My broader research interests are in:

- **Offline RL**: designing algorithms that can reliably learn from fixed datasets without unsafe trial-and-error exploration in sequential decision-making environments.

- **Mechanistic interpretability**: uncovering the internal computational mechanisms underlying intelligent systems, developing frameworks to understand how credit assignment, planning, and abstract representation learning work at the circuit and feature level.

- **Reasoning and human-inspired learning**: investigating complex reasoning tasks such as chain-of-thought inference, planning, and causal reasoning, while drawing on principles of human cognition to design algorithms that learn faster and generalize better.

- **Real-time decision making**: addressing latency and stability challenges for deploying intelligent systems in high-frequency, safety-critical environments where interpretability is crucial for trust and reliability.

The overarching theme of my work is to move from brittle, opaque models toward **principled algorithms that are mechanistically interpretable, sample-efficient, and reliable** in real-world conditions.

## Beyond Research

Outside of research, I enjoy reading about ancient civilizations, listening to classic rock, trekking, and strength training. I also write blogs reflecting on projects and life learnings.
