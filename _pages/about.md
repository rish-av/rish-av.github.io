My name is Rishav. I am an engineer at heart and nothing excites me more than scale. My long term goal is to provide deep learning solutions to masses at scale. 
I co-founded <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/539173-27">Offside</a> where I developed the entire tech, scaled the product to <strong>100k users</strong> and raised <strong>$300k</strong>  from prominent VCs and angels. Unfortunately though, our intuition failed and the product was not able to cement a place in the market.


Even before that I spent ~2 amazing years in Kasierslautern, Germany working at <a href="http://dfk.de">DFKI</a> in the augmented vision department as a Research Engineer where I developed real-time algorithms for precision farming. I graduated from <a href="https://bits-pilani.ac.in/">BITS Pilani, India</a> with an undergraduate degree in Computer Science in 2020. My larger goal is to develop robust, scalable and reliable machine learning systems (currently exploring DeepRL & robotics systems). I often write blogs on my learnings in various projects and about life in general.

While I am not working, I like to read about historical events, specially related to ancient civilizations or listen to music some old classic rock. I am a fan of historical dramas, trekking and strength training. Here's a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SwqALVUDQwYLwcYRkBKflBR1P08o-aJ8VTfL9AOMepI/edit?usp=sharing"> TODO. </a>
