            <strong>Plant Height Estimation: </strong>Worked on unsupervised deep learning algorithms for monocular depth estimation using drone images for estimating plant height at Chloropy Tech, Singapore. Implemented two approaches for the same & also assisted in creating a dataset for the same <br>
