- ***Plant Height Estimation:*** Worked on unsupervised deep learning algorithms for monocular depth estimation using drone
images for estimating plant height at Chloropy Tech, Singapore. Implemented two approaches for the same & also assisted in creating a dataset for the same. *The code will be released as soon as the persmission is granted by the organization.*


- ***Visual Commonsense Reasoning:*** Answer a question looking at a visual and then reason behind the answer. Trying new approaches. Used a new attention mechanism; the results improved but only marginally, *code will be released soon.*


- ***HSID-CNN:*** Worked on Deep Learning for cleaning and extraction of useful bands in hyperspectral images,
used google BigQuery for accessing LANDSAT data. Implemented HSID-CNN in tensorflow for denoising hyperspectral images.[**[code]**](https://github.com/rish-av/hsid-cnn)

- ***Active Learning:*** Implemented active learning algorithms on MNIST, tested various techniques like Query by committee & uncertainty sampling, also tested cluster based testing technique where whole dataset was labelled on the basis of just 10% of points. [[**code**]](https://github.com/rish-av/Machine-Learning-Assignments)


- ***Compiler:*** Constructed a compiler for a given language specification in C language, this included the develop-
ment of lexer, parser, semantic-analyzer, code-generator. [[**code**]](https://github.com/diveshuttam/CS-F363)


- ***Structural Health Monitoring:*** Implemented auto-regressive model for feature extraction and several unsupervised algorithms
like one-class SVM for final classification. [**[code]**](https://github.com/rish-av/shm_machineLearning)
